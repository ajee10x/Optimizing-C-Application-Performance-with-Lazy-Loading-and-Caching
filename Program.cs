        // Get data from database (assume this is an expensive operation)
        string[] data = GetDataFromDatabase();

        // Cache the data
        cache["data"] = data;

        // Lazy loading: Get the data from the cache only when needed
        string[] cachedData = (string[]) cache["data"];

        DisplayData(cachedData);

// In this example, we use a hash table to cache the data retrieved from the database, so that subsequent requests for the data can be served from the cache instead of hitting the database again. This reduces the number of expensive database queries, which can significantly improve the performance of the application.


// We also use lazy loading to avoid retrieving the data from the cache until it is actually needed. This can save memory and CPU resources by not loading unnecessary data into memory.



// This example is a simple illustration of how these techniques can be used to optimize the performance of a C# application. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your project, you may need to apply additional optimizations or use different techniques altogether.
